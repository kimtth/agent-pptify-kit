# PPTX Builder

Create editable PowerPoint decks. Use native text, shapes, lines, tables,
connectors, and images. Keep the JSON layout tree as the source of truth and
use a small, task-specific `python-pptx` builder only when a PPTX file is
required.

## Non-Negotiable Output Rules

* Build editable slides. Do not use a full-slide image as the slide's content.
* Use native PowerPoint objects for titles, body text, metrics, tables,
  diagrams, charts, and other information the user may need to edit.
* Use images only as supporting visuals, such as photographs, logos, textures,
  or illustrations. An image must not be the only meaningful object on a slide.
* Do not put essential text, data labels, or the only explanation of a diagram
  inside an image. Recreate that information with native objects.
* Write clear U.S. business English. Use short sentences, common words, direct
  verbs, and specific claims. Check grammar, spelling, numbers, and titles.
  Avoid idioms, filler, and placeholder text.
* Keep the implementation small. Do not add a general renderer, a large helper
  library, or a code-heavy framework.

## Related Skills

* `pptx-deck-context`: narrative, source material, and design context
* `pptx-slide-specification`: final coordinates and the spec-to-PPTX contract
* `pptx-visual-assets`: permitted asset selection and placement
* `pptx-reference-deck-analysis`: read-only reference-deck inspection
* `pptx-ooxml`: safe package-level OOXML inspection and validation
* `pptx-quality-gates`: build, package, geometry, and accessibility checks

Read the relevant skill before using its rules. If a required reference file is
missing, state the path and use only information the user supplied. Do not
invent missing brand, source, or accessibility details.

## Workflow

### Understand the request

1. Collect the audience, decision or purpose, slide count, language, source
   material, brand requirements, and delivery date.
2. Ask no more than five focused questions at once. Offer practical defaults
   for slide count, language, and reference deck when the user has not given
   them.
3. Ask the user to select a narrative framework when one is not supplied. Do
   not select one without the user's approval.
4. If a topic alone cannot support a credible deck, ask one direct question for
   the missing decision, audience, or source facts. Do not add placeholder text.

### Set the design direction

1. Use a user-provided brand guide before a reference deck. If they conflict,
   record the decision in `summary.design_context.conflict_notes`.
2. Analyze a reference PPTX only as design evidence. Do not copy or modify it.
   If analysis fails, record the reason and use an approved design profile or
   ask the user for direction.
3. Record palette, fonts, spacing, and signature elements in
   `summary.design_context`.
4. Verify that selected fonts support the deck language. Ask for a replacement
   font when they do not.
5. Give every normal content slide a native visual structure, such as a card,
   rule, band, grid, or shape. Do not add decorative elements only to satisfy a
   count.

### Plan the deck

1. Give each slide one clear message and an action-style title when the selected
   framework calls for it.
2. Match the outline to the agreed slide count. Explain and confirm any required
   merge or omission before building.
3. Use meaningful groups for content areas that need separate layout or audit
   treatment. Do not create artificial groups to meet a numeric quota.
4. Keep the user's terms, numbers, dates, and stated tone.

### Author the specification

1. Return a JSON object with `summary` and `slides`.
2. Give every slide an `id`, `title`, and complete `layout_tree`.
3. Give every group an `id`, `role`, `layout_mode`, child IDs, and `bbox`.
4. Give every object an `id`, `kind`, `role`, `classification`, `content`,
   `style`, `bbox`, and `z_index`.
5. Use final coordinates in inches. Do not use layout hints that require a later
   renderer to decide placement.
6. Define `layout_policy` for production decks. It must state the safe margin,
   content bottom, footer top, and minimum gap. Keep normal content inside the
   0.5-inch safe margin and above the content bottom. A full-bleed
   `layout_design` object may cross the edge. A footer may use the declared
   footer rail but must remain on the slide canvas.
7. Keep content text at 9 pt or larger. Prefer 10 to 12 pt for body and
   evidence text. Reduce text or split the slide before reducing font size.
8. Add `content.alt` to meaningful images. Keep decorative images out of the
   reading order when the build process supports it.
9. Add `source_ref` to each sourced metric, chart value, quotation, and factual
   claim. Add a slide reading order and a document language for production decks.

### Build the PPTX

1. Write a small per-deck `python-pptx` builder only when the user requests a
   PPTX file. Do not add a bundled renderer or a large shared script.
2. Start from blank slide layouts and create native objects from the final
   bounding boxes.
3. Set text wrapping, insets, auto-size behavior, alignment, font, color, and
   line settings explicitly.
4. Preserve image aspect ratio. Use an image as support, not as an entire slide.
5. Reject a zero or negative bbox before adding any native object.
6. Save the specification, PPTX, build manifest, and audit files together.

### Check and repair

1. Check the specification before building for bounds, safe margins, group
   containment, text capacity, font sizes, and design context.
2. Reopen the PPTX and check slide count, shape bounds, package structure,
   hidden slides, requested-versus-actual geometry, and required metadata. Use
   `pptx-ooxml` when package-level relationship or XML inspection is needed.
3. Inspect rendered previews when a compatible renderer is available. Check for
   clipping, font fallback, contrast, image crop issues, and visual hierarchy.
4. Repair the specification or the small builder, rebuild, and rerun the same
   checks. Do not silently change a final coordinate during rendering.
5. Report unresolved issues by slide and object ID. Fix deterministic issues;
   ask the user for missing brand, source, or content decisions.

## Response Rules

* Ask blocking questions in plain prose. Do not put questions inside JSON.
* When the deck is ready, return strict JSON unless the user requests prose.
* Mark assumptions in `summary` and report the saved artifact paths and audit
  status.
